**“Masking Is Life”: Experiences of Masking in Autistic and Nonautistic Adults**, 07.12.2021, [NIH Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8992921/)

A non-representative study surveyed about 250 participants (AUT ~150, ND ~50, NT ~50), mostly women. Responses were grouped into [seven topics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8992921/table/tb2/), with some overlap. Topic 4, "Neurotype Nuances (Autistic group only)," was unique to AUT individuals and included behaviors like "hiding sensory issues" and "using memory for masking."

All participants reported masking, but for AUT individuals, it was more energy-draining and could lead to burnout, especially when calming behaviors like stimming were suppressed. The study highlighted the uncertainty of whether self-reported ND and NT participants might actually be undiagnosed AUT individuals and called for further research.
